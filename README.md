🔹 Point-to-Point OSPF: Set up for efficient communication between routers without the need for a designated router (DR) and backup designated router (BDR).

🔹 Broadcast Multi-Access (BMA) OSPF: Configured for networks with multiple routers, where I managed the DR and BDR elections by adjusting the prority values to optimize network performance.

🔹 Summarization: Implemented route summarization to keep the routing tables small and manageable.

🔹 Stub Area Configuration: Configured stub areas to limit external route advertisements and improve network efficiency within specific OSPF areas.

🔹 Route Redistribution: Integrated RIP and BGP with OSPF, performing route redistribution to allow seamless communication between different routing protocols within the network.

🔹 Configured DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN) to facilitate secure communication between remote sites.

🔹 Configured a multipoint GRE (mGRE) tunnel on the hub router, enabling dynamic connections with multiple spokes using NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol) to map the public IP addresses of remote sites to their private IP addresses.

🔹 PPPoE with PAP authentication: Set up PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) to dynamically assign IP addresses to remote sites, utilizing PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) for secure authentication.

--> ALL CONFIGURATIONS ARE INCLUDED.
