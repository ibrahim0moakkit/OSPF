# OSPF

Comprehensive OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) topology on EVE-NG.

ðŸ”¹ Point-to-Point OSPF: Set up for efficient communication between routers without the need for a designated router (DR) and backup designated router (BDR).

ðŸ”¹ Broadcast Multi-Access (BMA) OSPF: Configured for networks with multiple routers, where I managed the DR and BDR elections by adjusting the prority values to optimize network performance.

ðŸ”¹ Summarization: Implemented route summarization to keep the routing tables small and manageable.

ðŸ”¹ Route Redistribution: Integrated RIP with OSPF, performing route redistribution to allow seamless communication between different routing protocols within the network.

ðŸ”¹ Stub Area Configuration: Configured stub areas to limit external route advertisements and improve network efficiency within specific OSPF areas.

--> ALL CONFIGURATIONS ARE INCLUDED.
